## Installation

### Recommended: FUSAM Add-on Manager

FUSAM Integration:
https://sidiousious.gitlab.io/bc-addon-loader/

Search for `BCNeko` or `Bondage Club Neko Chat Enhancer` in FUSAM add-on manager to enable/disable the catgirl plugin. FUSAM lets you manage multiple Bondage Club plugins in one place, ideal for long-term use.

### Userscript Installation

Alternatively, install Tampermonkey or another userscript manager, then choose a version to install:

Production version:
https://github.com/QAQMOON/bondage-club-neko-chat-enhancer/raw/main/bondage-club-neko.user.js

Dev version:
https://github.com/QAQMOON/bondage-club-neko-chat-enhancer/raw/main/bondage-club-neko-dev.user.js

Bug version:
https://github.com/QAQMOON/bondage-club-neko-chat-enhancer/raw/main/bondage-club-neko-bug.user.js

The Bug version is recommended for userscript installation only, for testing experimental features like RP speech packs; it's not included in FUSAM.

## Updates

The plugin now uses dynamic loading. After installing the production, dev, or bug version entry script, every time you refresh the game or re-enter, it will automatically pull the latest plugin core from GitHub for that version.

- Production version loads `dist/bondage-club-neko.runtime.js`
- Dev version loads `dist/bondage-club-neko.dev.runtime.js`
- Bug version loads `dist/bondage-club-neko.bug.runtime.js`

If GitHub is temporarily unreachable, the plugin will try to use the last successfully loaded cached version. The loader entry script rarely changes; you only need to check for updates in your userscript manager when the entry script itself updates.

## Action Library

Action templates are stored at:

https://github.com/QAQMOON/bondage-club-neko-chat-enhancer/blob/main/actions/catgirl-actions.json

The plugin tries to load the action library from GitHub on startup; if loading fails, it uses the last cache, or built-in default actions if there's no cache.

To add a new action theme, append an item to the `actions` array:

```json
{
  “id”: “kiss”,
  “label”: “亲亲”,
  “enabled”: true,
  “self”: [
    “轻轻碰了碰自己的指尖，假装这是一个小小亲亲喵~”
  ],
  “target”: [
    “轻轻亲了亲 {target}，然后害羞地别过脸喵~”
  ]
}
```

`label` displays on the action wheel button; `self` is used when there's no target or acting on self; `target` is used when acting on another character.

## Kaomoji Library

Kaomoji library is stored at:

https://github.com/QAQMOON/bondage-club-neko-chat-enhancer/blob/main/kaomoji/cute-kaomoji.json

The plugin tries to load the kaomoji library from GitHub on startup; if loading fails, it uses the last cache, or built-in default cat kaomoji if there's no cache.

To add new kaomoji, append a string to the corresponding category's `items` array. To add a new category, append an item to the `groups` array:

```json
{
  “id”: “kiss”,
  “label”: “亲亲”,
  “enabled”: true,
  “items”: [
    “( ˘ ³˘)♥”,
    “(๑˘ ³˘๑)”
  ]
}
```

Setting `enabled` to `false` temporarily disables a category; the plugin randomly picks kaomoji from all enabled categories.

## Notes

This is a UI enhancement script for Bondage Club, not a standalone web app.
If you see the settings page in-game, look for “Catgirl Settings” under “Settings -> Extension Components” first.
